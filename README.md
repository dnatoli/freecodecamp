# freecodecamp
Working through the freeCodeCamp lessons ([here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn)) as a way to learn web development basics! This is a way for me to fill the gaps in my skills, as I didn't do much of this in school and my professional experience has been mostly on the back-end. I've found I learn best by starting from the ground up, so I'm doing this in order starting with raw HTML/CSS and working my way to more advanced topics.
